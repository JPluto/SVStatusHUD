h1. SVStatusHUD

SVStatusHUD mimics the HUD shown on orientation lock, mute and volume change on iOS. *It should only be used in response to hardware or other important notifications* (for instance when an accessory is detected by your app). If you're just looking to show the progress or success of an operation, you should have a look at "SVProgressHUD":https://github.com/samvermette/SVProgressHUD.

*SVStatusHUD features:*

* simple singleton convenience methods (@[SVStatus method]@)
* automatic styling of the image it's provided
* optional status string and showing duration
* automatic positioning based on device type and orientation

h2. Installation

* Drag the @SVStatusHUD/SVStatusHUD@ folder into your project. 
* Add the *QuartzCore* framework to your project. 

__If you plan on using SVStatusHUD in a lot of places inside your app, I recommend importing it directly inside your prefix file.__

h2. Usage

(see sample Xcode project in @/Demo@)

SVStatusHUD is created as a singleton (i.e. it doesn't need to be explicitly allocated and instantiated; you directly call @[SVStatusHUD method]@) and can be shown using one of the following convenience/class methods:

<pre>
+ (void)showWithImage:(UIImage*)image;
+ (void)showWithImage:(UIImage*)image status:(NSString*)string;
+ (void)showWithImage:(UIImage*)image status:(NSString*)string duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration;
</pre>

*Important*: for crispier rendering, provided image should precisely be 86x86 pixels (retina: 172x172).


h2. Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) support

Maintaining an official ARC branch has proven to be too much work, often leading to confusion since the ARC branch is always a few commits behind. If you'd like to use SVStatusHUD in your ARC-enabled project, you'll have to "add the @-fno-objc-arc@ compiler flag":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646052/how-can-i-disable-arc-for-a-single-file-in-a-project to all of SVStatusHUD's files.
